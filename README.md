## Leaderboard

Not so good if we look at the final position (2055) but only 0.0239 (_categorization accuracy_ was the metric) worse than the winner out of 3900 competitors

## Final Comments

+ I did not spend so much time trying to improve the metric. In fact, I only made 3 submissions.
+ It was one of my first kaggle competitions and I was focused more on the environment in Kaggle than in the competition problem itself
+ I need to understand the problem deeper if I want to try more things to get a better performance: what augmentations to use, using other external datasets and so on
